This repository contains the programming assignments we had to submit in the course [CS220: Computer Organisation](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/pages/CS220.html) (2021-22 II Sem.) in a team of three.<br> 
The languages used in assignments were majorly `Verilog` and `Assembly` ([MIPS ISA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIPS_architecture)).

The repository doesn't contain `.vvp` and `.vcd` files but can be generated by running the commands written [here](Instructions.md) in the directory that contains the corresponding `.v` file.<br>

## Assignment Summary

+ <u>[Assignment 1:](./A1/)</u> Implement an `8-bit adder`, `8-bit comparator`, `3-to-8 decoder`, and an `8-to-3 priority encoder`.
+ <u>[Assignment 2:](./A2/)</u> Implement an `8-bit carry look-ahead adder`, and an `8-bit Johnson Counter`.
+ <u>[Assignment 3:](./A3/)</u> Implement a `(1010) Sequence Detector`, and a `3-bit Odd Parity Generator` in the form of an `FSM`.
+ <u>[Assignment 4:](./A4/)</u> Implement a `3-bit Gray code counter` in the form of an `FSM`, and an `8-bit adder/subtractor`.
+ <u>[Assignment 5:](./A5/)</u> Implement a `GCD calculator` [Stein's Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_GCD_algorithm) in `Verilog`, and write code for `Insertion Sort`, generating `Fibonacci Numbers`, and `alternatively adding/subtracting` floats in a vector of size `p` in `MIPS`.
