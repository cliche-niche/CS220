This repository contains the programming assignments we had to submit in the course [CS220: Computer Organisation](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/pages/CS220.html) (2021-22 II Sem.) in a team of three.

The repository doesn't contain `.vvp` and `.vcd` files but can be generated by running the commands written [here](Instructions.md) in the directory that contains the corresponding `.v` file.
